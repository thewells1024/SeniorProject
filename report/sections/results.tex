\section{Results}

By leveraging the unit library in Typed Racket, we remove the need for creating a structure to allow composition of the modules. Using units also gives a simple way of solving the need for a circular  dependency structure.

\subsection{Considerations}
~

This system allows a user to optimize performance to suit their individual requirements. For instance, a programmer writing a program that uses many operations from the State module and few from the Control module, may wish to link the State module closer to the top than the Control module.

One drawback is that the signatures require knowledge of what types the language will handle. This means that it is not possible to completely decouple the modules from each other.
